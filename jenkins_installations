#Jenkins Redhat Packages
To use this repository, run the following command:
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key

If you've previously imported the key from Jenkins, the rpm --import will fail because you already have a key. Please ignore that and move on.
